# Project Requirements

## Full Application with Front-End and Back-End:
- The application must include both a Front-End and Back-End.
- Back-End should be built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Entities Management:
- The app should manage at least two entities, excluding users, that are interconnected.
- These entities should have meaningful relationships, such as:
  - Tasks and Categories
  - Posts and comments
  - Products and Orders

## User Authentication & Permissions:
- The app should support user registration and login functionality.
- Users must have different permissions/roles to control access to various parts of the application (e.g., admin, user).

## Modular and Well-Organized Code:
- The codebase must be divided into functions and modules, ensuring a clear separation of concerns.
- The application should follow proper abstraction levels, i.e., separating:
  - Business logic
  - Data access
  - API routes
